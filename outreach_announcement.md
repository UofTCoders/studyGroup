Hi all,

I wanted to let you know about the coding and open research Study Group recently started at the University of Toronto. The Mozilla Science Lab has started a series of meetup groups for scientists and researchers to get together, share coding skills, and help each other out with the programming nearly all of us have to do as part of our research. Since June, the U of T Study Group has met weekly, and we've covered topics in Python, Git, and R and discussed many other topics related to life as a researcher. 

Most Study Group sessions are hour-long tutorials where one person from our community leads a hands-on demonstration of a tool, package or piece of code, while everyone else follows along. Also, we get together once in a while for open coworking sessions to work on our own research coding and get help with questions as they arise. The tutorial sessions are led by volunteers, and the curriculum and schedule is up to us to set. 

Our next meeting will be <event title> on September 10, 2015 at 6 pm in MP408 (McLennan Physical Laboratories). Everyone is welcome, regardless of experience level. If you can't make it out but have ideas or questions, please post a thread on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/UofTCoders/studyGroup/issues) or check out the group [website](
http://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/). Also, if you could take a second to fill out [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QIRsnaJjpf5sTV_nMC9KEA44Mz21wuASDxttdgTBj44/viewform?usp=send_form) to let us know what you'd be interested in, that would be a big help, too. Finally, if you'd like updates on what our Study Group is doing, watch our [events repository](https://github.com/UofTCoders/Events) by clicking 'Watch' at the top of our Github repo. 

Thanks!

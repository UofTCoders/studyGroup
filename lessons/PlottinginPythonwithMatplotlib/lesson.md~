This lesson will introduce users to basic plotting in python as well as basic graphs with research quality figures.  There is also a script that allows users to quickly modify a figure for different publications.  For more advanced users, there is a script that creates a particle trajectory movie from matplotlib and ffmpeg.

*hwk2-1.py is basic plotting
*hwk2-2.py and 3.1.py are for reproduble figures using root finding in python
*example.py and 3.2.py are for making movies

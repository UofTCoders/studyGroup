Dear SCF Mentoring Subcommittee,

We are writing to express our interested to attend the two-day training course in December 2015 as one group composed of:

Madeleine Bonsma (@mbonsma on GitHub),
Lindsay Coome (@lcoome on GitHub),
NAME_OF_3RD_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub),
NAME_OF_4TH_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub),
NAME_OF_5TH_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub) and
NAME_OF_6TH_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub).

Madeleine Bonsma is the organizer of a scientific progamming peer learning group at the University of Toronto (University of Toronto Scientific Coders) and is on the waitlist for instructor training. Lindsay Coome is a session leader in the University of Toronto Scientific Coders group and is on the waitlist for instructor training. 

NAME_OF_2ND_STUDENT attended a SCF workshop in 2015. NAME_OF_3RD_STUDENT attended a DC workshop in 2015. NAME_OF_1ST_STUDENT was a helper at the last SCF/DC workshop organized at our university that was lead by INSTRUCTOR_NAME.

If we are selected for the instructor training we will use a seminar room in the Claude T. Bissell Building. We already made reservations for that room in advance.

We are planing to organize two workshops at the beginning of 2016. One will be Python based and will have NAME_OF_1ST_STUDENT, NAME_OF_2ND_STUDENT, NAME_OF_4TH_STUDENT and NSTRUCTOR_NAME as instructors. The other one will be R based and will have NAME_OF_3RD_STUDENT, NAME_OF_5TH_STUDENT, NAME_OF_6TH_STUDENT and INSTRUCTOR_NAME as instructors. We will use the same room used for the last workshop and we already talked with INSTRUCTOR_NAME about those workshops. 

Thanks for your consideration.
